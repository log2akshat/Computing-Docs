# Computing Docs
This repo contains the code for creating and maintaining Computing Docs written by me on trac wiki. It has basically two containers where trac is running with apache webserver on one container and MariaDB is running on the other one. This code is deployed on RedHat OpenShift environment.

This repo also contains the Database backup of Computing Docs wiki where I have documented all the major software and hardware Installations and Configurations on which I have worked.
